## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages('caret')
library(caret)
team<- read.csv("/Users/dilruba_p/Desktop/team_all.csv")
head(team)
team <- team[,-(70:73),drop=FALSE]
team <- team[,-(1:3),drop=FALSE]
team_train_row= createDataPartition(team$pct, p = 0.80, list = FALSE)
varImp(mod_fit)
team_train = team[team_train_row,]
 team_test = team[-team_train_row,]
```

## Introducing the models

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# models

fit.lm = train(data = team_train, pct~., method = "lm")
fit.lasso = train(data = team_train, pct~., method = "lasso")
fit.ridge = train(data =team_train, pct~., method = "ridge")
fit.lasso$results
fit.lasso$bestTune
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# models
install.packages('glmnet')
library(glmnet)


grid <- 10^seq(10,-2,length=1000)
team <- na.omit(team)
lm_fit <- lm(pct ~ .,team_train) 
lm_fit$coefficients
vif(lm_fit)
y <-team$pct
str(y)
x <- team%>% select(-pct) %>% data.matrix()
x <- team %>%
  select( assists, rebounds , efgpct, ptsputbacks, tspct , X3    ,loss  , shotqualityavg , ftsmade, nonheavefg3pct ) %>%
  data.matrix()
lasso.mod <-glmnet(x,team$pct,alpha=1,lambda = grid)
coef(lasso.mod )
cv_fit2<- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha = 1, lambda = grid)
plot(cv_fit2)
bestlam=cv_fit2$lambda.min
bestlam
# glmnet() function standardizes the variables by default so that they are on the same scale.
# If alpha=0 then a ridge regression model is fit, and if alpha=1 then a lasso model is fit.

dim(coef(lasso.mod ))
lasso.pred=predict(lasso.mod,s=bestlam,newx=)
mse= mean((lasso.pred-y.test)^2)


out=glmnet(all_x,all_y,alpha=1,lambda=grid)
lasso.coef=predict(cv_fit2,type="coefficients",s=bestlam)
lasso.coef
```
